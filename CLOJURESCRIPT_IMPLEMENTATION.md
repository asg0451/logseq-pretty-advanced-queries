# ClojureScript Evaluation Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds support for evaluating ClojureScript components in advanced Logseq queries, specifically `:view` and `:result-transform` components. The implementation provides a foundation that can be extended with full ClojureScript compilation when needed.

## Features Implemented

1. **ClojureScript Evaluator**: A simplified evaluator that handles common view function patterns
2. **View Function Support**: Process `:view` components in advanced query maps
3. **Result Transform Support**: Process `:result-transform` components in advanced query maps
4. **Query Runner Integration**: Extended the existing query runner to apply these transformations
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added tests for all new functionality

## Architecture

### Core Components

- `src/utils/clojureScriptEvaluator.ts`: Main evaluator with support for basic ClojureScript patterns
- `src/utils/queryRunner.ts`: Extended to process view and result-transform components
- Tests: Comprehensive test coverage for all functionality

### Supported Patterns

The simplified implementation currently supports these ClojureScript function patterns:

1. **Map First**: `(fn [data] (map first data))` - Extracts first element from each tuple
2. **Count**: `(fn [data] (count data))` - Returns count of items
3. **Take N**: `(fn [data] (take N data))` - Takes first N items
4. **Identity**: For unsupported patterns, returns an identity function

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback to original query results if evaluation fails
- Warning messages for unsupported patterns
- Comprehensive error logging

## Usage Examples

### Basic View Function
```clojure
{:title "Example"
 :query [:find ?b :where [?b :block/refs #{"TODO"}]]
 :view (fn [data] (map first data))}
```

### Result Transform
```clojure
{:title "Example"
 :query [:find ?b :where [?b :block/refs #{"TODO"}]]
 :result-transform (fn [data] (take 5 data))}
```

### Combined Usage
```clojure
{:title "Example"
 :query [:find ?b :where [?b :block/refs #{"TODO"}]]
 :result-transform (fn [data] (take 10 data))
 :view (fn [data] (map first data))}
```

## Future Enhancements

For full ClojureScript support, the following could be added:

1. **Self-hosted ClojureScript**: Integration with cljs.js for complete ClojureScript compilation
2. **Extended Pattern Support**: More sophisticated ClojureScript function pattern recognition
3. **Namespace Support**: Support for ClojureScript namespaces and require statements
4. **Macro Support**: Support for ClojureScript macros

## Notes

- This implementation prioritizes reliability and graceful degradation
- The simplified approach handles the most common use cases for view functions
- Full ClojureScript compilation would require additional build configuration and dependencies
- All functionality is thoroughly tested and follows TypeScript best practices

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Basic evaluation functionality
- Function pattern recognition
- View function evaluation
- Result transform evaluation
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Integration with the query runner

All tests pass and the implementation builds successfully.
